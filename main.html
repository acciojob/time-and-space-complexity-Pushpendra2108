    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the
        input. It measures how the runtime of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. Efficient algorithms
        have lower time complexity, meaning they can handle larger inputs more quickly.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space Complexity is another important aspect of algorithm analysis. It measures the amount of memory space an
        algorithm requires to execute as a function of the size of the input. Algorithms with space complexity O(n) use
        a linear amount of space relative to the size of the input. <b>Space Complexity</b> analysis is crucial for
        understanding how much memory an algorithm needs, especially when dealing with large datasets.
